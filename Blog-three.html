      <h2>What is Web Framework?</h2>
      <p>Posted by <strong>Paul Dimaisip</strong></p>
    </header>
    
    <p>A <strong>web framework</strong> is like a toolbox for web developers. It provides a structured way to build and develop web applications. This toolbox contains libraries, tools, and best practices to help developers create robust and scalable web applications more efficiently.</p>

    <p>Essentially, it saves developers from reinventing the wheel by offering pre-built components for common tasks like handling requests, managing sessions, and connecting to databases.</p>
    
 	<a>Some popular web frameworks include:</a>
    <ul>
    
      <li>Django (Python)</li>
      <li>Ruby on Rails (Ruby)</li>
      <li>Express.js (Node.js)</li>
	  <li>Laravel (PHP)</li>
      <li>Angular (JavaScript/TypeScript)</li>
    </ul>
    	<p>Using a web framework can help developers focus on writing application-specific code instead of dealing with low-level details.</p>

	<h3>Django (Python)</h3>
		<p>Known for its "batteries-included" philosophy, <strong>Django</strong> provides many features out-of-the-box. Django is a high-level web framework for Python that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It was created to make it easier to build complex, database-driven websites. Whether you want to deploy your application on a traditional web server, in the cloud, or using a containerization solution like Docker, Django has you covered.</p>

	<h3>Ruby on Rails (Ruby)</h3>
		<p><strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> emphasizes convention over configuration, making it quick to get started. Rails is known for its developer-friendly nature, allowing for rapid development cycles and quick iterations. There are plenty of tutorials, documentation, and forums where developers can seek help and share knowledge. While initially designed for rapid prototyping, Rails can scale to handle large-scale applications. Examples include GitHub, Airbnb, and Shopify.  </p>

	<h3>Node.js</h3>	
		<p><strong>Express.js (Node.js)</strong> is a minimal and flexible framework for building web applications in JavaScript. It is a powerful, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. With Node.js, developers can use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development, creating a more unified and consistent development environment. is particularly well-suited for applications that need to handle numerous simultaneous connections with high throughput, such as APIs, real-time web applications, and microservices.</p>

	<h3>Laravel</h3>
		<p><strong>Laravel (PHP)</strong> is a powerful and elegant web application framework for PHP that aims to make the process of web development more enjoyable and less cumbersome. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern, which separates the application logic from the presentation layer, making it easier to manage and maintain your code. Laravel has comprehensive and well-organized documentation, along with a large community of developers who contribute tutorials, forums, and packages. It is known for its clean and elegant syntax, which makes coding enjoyable and easy to read.</p>	

	<h3>Angular</h3>	
		<p><strong>Angular (JavaScript/TypeScript)</strong>, a platform for building mobile and desktop web applications. It is a robust, open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google. It's designed to make the development and testing of single-page applications (SPAs) more efficient. Angular is built around components, which are self-contained units of functionality that can be reused throughout an application. This makes your code more modular, maintainable, and testable. Angular's powerful router enables developers to build SPAs with multiple views, navigating between them without reloading the entire page.</p>
